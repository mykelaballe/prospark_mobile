# About The App
As a Learning Management System, as well as a B2B-marketed app, companies are able to create course lessons and assessments. Lessons can be a video, an audio, a document or a link. Users also take assessments and surveys. Scores are then generated, admin users are able to see reports and charts about the courses and users. Users also gain badges as they continue to take courses and pass them.

Customizations to the core features can also be applied depending on the client's request. Whether they want their customizations to be housed in a white-labeled app or just use the core version and load them dynamically.

### Dynamic customizations via CodePush + GIT
This feature enables the core version of the app to apply client-specific customizations without having to build a dedicated app or project and without having to submit in Google Play Store and Apple Store.

The way to achieve this is by using over-the-air-updates and source code versioning, in this case, CodePush and GIT respectively.
