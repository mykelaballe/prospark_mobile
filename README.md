# About The App
As a Learning Management System, as well as a B2B-marketed app, companies are able to create course lessons and assessments. Lessons can be a video, an audio, a document or a link. Users also take assessments and surveys. Scores are then generated, admin users are able to see reports and charts about the courses and users. Users also gain badges as they continue to take courses and pass them.

Customizations to the core features can also be applied depending on the client's request. Whether they want their customizations to be housed in a white-labeled app or just use the core version and load them dynamically.

### My Contribution
Solely built the app from the ground-up for both Android and iOS
